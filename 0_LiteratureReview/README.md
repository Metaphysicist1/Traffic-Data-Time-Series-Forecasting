**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Attention-Based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting

  - [Link](AGCNT.pdf) 
  - **Objective**: Improve traffic flow forecasting accuracy by addressing the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations in traffic data.
  - **Methods**: Propose ASTGCN: Attention‑based Spatial‑Temporal Graph Convolutional Network.
  - **Outcomes**: The model effectively captured nonlinear, time-varying spatial–temporal dependencies, validating the design of separate temporal components fused via attention
  - **Relation to the Project**: The model proposed in the paper consists of three parallel components, each modeling one temporal aspect (recent, daily, weekly). 

- **Source 2**: [GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS FOR TRAFFIC FORECASTING]

  - **[Link](HNTF.pdf)**
  - **Objective**: Overcome the shortcomings of previous models that struggle with nonlinear and complex patterns in traffic flow.
  - **Methods**: Propose a novel model that integrates spatial and temporal information to better predict traffic flow.
  - **Outcomes**: Showcase the model's potential for real-world traffic management and planning applications.
  - **Relation to the Project**: The model's integration of graph structure and temporal modeling better reflects the real-world dynamics of traffic.
