**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [Attention-Based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting]

  - [Link](AGCNT.pdf) 
  - **Objective**: Improve traffic flow forecasting accuracy by addressing the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations in traffic data.
  - **Methods**: Propose ASTGCN: Attention‑based Spatial‑Temporal Graph Convolutional Network.
  - **Outcomes**: The model effectively captured nonlinear, time-varying spatial–temporal dependencies, validating the design of separate temporal components fused via attention
  - **Relation to the Project**: The model proposed in the paper consists of three parallel components, each modeling one temporal aspect (recent, daily, weekly).
